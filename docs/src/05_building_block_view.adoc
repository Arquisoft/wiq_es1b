== Building Block View

The Building Block view shows the decomposition of the WIQ system into different building blocks that will represent different
aspects of the webapp. It will help by giving a clear image of the overall system and also the inside of it.


=== Whitebox Overall System

Motivation::

The user interacts with the webapp interface to be able to play the game. In the diagram it is clear to see that the webbApp interacts
with an external box which is Wikidata, as it is a requirement of the game to generate the questions.
In subsequent levels, the webApp will be decomposed into more detail.


==== WebApp

The WebApp box consists of the entire game with all the different responsibilities the game might have all together.
The interface of the WebApp serves as the frontend of a web application, that will be detailed in other diagrams.

==== Wikidata

The purpose of the Wikidata box is to get the necessary information to generate all the questions for all the games.
The web app will interact with Wikidata by SPARQL querys which will be stored in the database. 


=== Level 2

==== Interfaces

It consists of the interfaces with which the user will interact to play the game and use all of the different services it provides.
There will be different interfaces for the different parts of the webapp, all of them will be connected with eachother.
These interfaces will be atractive to the user and easy to use, as well as fast-charging not to make the users wait much.
These interfaces are the ones that calls for something to be done, so they interact with the gateway.

==== Gateway

The gateway is the place where every request is redirected to the service where it belongs to as that information is not visible for the user.

==== Services

The different services are the ones that internally take care of all the data in the server. They also deal with
the requests sent by the gateway and generate a response to it, a good one or the error related to it. To generate the response,
the services need data from the database or Wikidata, so they interact with them and sends the data as the response to show the user, for example.

==== MongoDb

MongoDb is the service we will use to store our data. We will keep it in a cluster in which there are 
different collections to separate the data. Templates of the entities we save are seen in the project and
there are some for the users and their record and others for the questions.


=== Level 3

==== Question Generator

The Question Generator is the service that interacts with the Wikidata external service through SPARQL querys.
It is dedicated to generate the questions and the answers and send them to the database to store there to later show 
in the game. 

==== Record

The record service is the one that answers the requests related to save or get the games and statistics of the player.
It interacts with the user collection in the MongoDb database and stores there the data. It also sends the data for the 
user to see.

====  Users

===== Auth service

This is one service inside the users part of the webapp. It is in charge of authenticating the users when they register for the 
first time in the game. All the data gets collected and saved in the collection users in MongoDb for when they login later. It uses the same 
database that the record service uses.

===== Users service

This is one service inside the users part of the webapp. This one is the one users use everytime when they log in. It retrieves
all their data from the database and shows them in the webApp as the users will have an option to view all their past data. It gets 
the data from the same collection as the auth service and the record.
