== Building Block View

The Building Block view shows the decomposition of the WIQ system into different building blocks that will represent different
aspects of the webapp. It will help by giving a clear image of the overall system and also the inside of it.
It is a preliminary decomposition of the webApp as it might change, not drastically, throughout the development of the game.


=== Whitebox Overall System

image::buildingBlock1.png["Overall System"]

Motivation::

The user interacts with the webapp interface to be able to play the game. In the diagram it is clear to see that the webbApp interacts
with an external box which is Wikidata as it is a requirement of the game to generate the qestions. In other levels, the webApp will decompose
in more detail.

Contained Building Blocks::

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|User | The users who interact with the webApp and play the game.
|WebApp | The WebApp called WIQ which consists in a game of questions and answers.
|Wikidata | The external source of information that the webApp uses to generate que questions.
|===


==== WebApp

The WebApp box consists of the entire game with all the different responsibilities the game might have all together.
The interface of the WebApp will be the frontend of a web that will be seen better in other diagrams.

==== Wikdata

The purpose of the Wikidata box is to get the necessary information to generate all the questions of all the games.
The game will interact with Wikidata by sparql querys. 



=== Level 2

==== White Box Interfaces

It consists of the interfaces with which the user will interact to play the game and use all of the different services it provides.
There will be differente interfaces for all different services of the game and the users will be able to go through all of them.
These interfaces will be atractive to the user and easy to use, as well as fast-charging not to make the users wait much.

==== White Box Microservices

The components of the webApp are the microservices, apart from the interfaces, which will have all the logic of the game and are the ones
who will interact with the external services (Wikidata, mongodb). There will be one microservice for each one of the responsibilities of the game.
These microservices will need to be fast in getting all the data they need and they need to communicate with the interfaces to be able to show 
the user all they need to know to play the game.


=== Level 3

==== White Box Question Generator

The Question Generator is the microservice that interacts with the Wikidata external service through SPARQL.
It is the microservice dedicated to generate the questions and the answers and pass them to the interface to show them to the user. 

==== White Box Users service

The users service is another microservice. It is the one in charge of collecting all the data from the users when they register and
to retrieve all their data when they login.
They also interact with the interface of the game.

=== Level 4

==== White Box Auth service
This is one microservice inside of the microservice Users service. It is in charge of authenticate the users when they register for the 
first time in the game. All the data gets collected and saved in the database MongoDb for when they login later.

==== White Box Login service
This is another microservice inside the Users service. This one is the one users use everytime when they log in. It retrieves
all their data from the database MongoDb and shows them in the webApp as the users will have an option to view all their past data.
