== Runtime View


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the system’s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...

=== Question Scenario
image::questionScenarioDiagram.png["Diagram of a user asking for and answering a question of the game"]
In the diagram we can see one user interacting with the app by getting and answering a question of the game.
In this scenario there can be two different sub-scenarios, one where the user chooses the right answer and
the game shows in the view that it is correct, and other where the answer choosed is wrong and the game 
also makes it seen to the user.

building block instances depicted in this diagram.>_

It is possible to use a sequence diagram:

[plantuml,"Sequence diagram",png]
----
actor Alice
actor Bob
database Pod as "Bob's Pod"
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
Alice  --> Pod: Store route
Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
----

=== Register Scenario
image::registerScenarioDiagram.png["Diagram of a user registering in the application"]
The diagram shows a sequence of consecutive actions that a user takes in order to access to the main 
interface of the application.


The user first insert his/her data into the corresponding fields, after that, clicking on the register button
will perform a series of actions inside the system that the user won´t be seeing. 
First, the gateway service will recognize the action of adding the user and it will redirect the request to the
auth service, which is the one in charge of validating the fields previously specified by the user. Finally, 
the connection with the database will be made and, if everything is correct, the user information will be saved.
