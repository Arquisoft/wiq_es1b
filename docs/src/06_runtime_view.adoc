=== Question Scenario
image::questionScenarioDiagram.png["Diagram of a user asking for and answering a question of the game"]
In the diagram we can see one user interacting with the app by getting and answering a question of the game.
In this scenario there can be two different sub-scenarios, one where the user chooses the right answer and
the game shows in the view that it is correct, and other where the answer choosed is wrong and the game 
also makes it seen to the user.


=== Register Scenario
image::registerScenarioDiagram.png["Diagram of a user registering in the application"]


The diagram shows a sequence of consecutive actions that a user takes in order to access to the main 
interface of the application.


The user first insert his/her data into the corresponding fields, after that, clicking on the register button
will perform a series of actions inside the system that the user won´t be seeing. 
First, the gateway service will recognize the action of adding the user and it will redirect the request to the
auth service, which is the one in charge of validating the fields previously specified by the user. Finally, 
the connection with the database will be made and, if everything is correct, the user information will be saved.


=== Login Scenario
image::loginScenarioDiagram.png["Diagram of a user logging into the application"]


This diagram explains the sequence that every user follows in order to sign into the application.




This flowchart is very similar to the previous one because the actions are basically the same:
insert the user data in the fields. However, the system reacts in a different way than before, that´s 
because the user has already signed up previously and the database has registered that information on 
the system. This time, the action sent by the auth service to the database is to search if there´s
any user whose data corresponds to those obtained previously. If the user has not signed up yet 
the application will notify him that an error on the authentication has ocurred.

=== Save record Scenario
image::saveRecordScenario.png["Diagram of a record save"]

In this diagram we can see the sequence for saving a game. When the game is over, the user is redirected to the Game Final screen,
where he/she will click on the "Save record" button to save that game in the history.
First, the gateway service will recognize the action of saving a game, and redirect the request to the history service,
who, after creating the connection to the database, will search for the current user. Once the current user has been obtained from the database, the object
object is created, with the obtained user and the game questions (which have been stored at game time). Finally, the game is saved
in the database.

=== Get record Scenario
image::getRecordScenario.png["Diagram of a logged user getting his records"]

This diagram shows the process by which a user, previously logged in, accesses the history of his games.
First, the user will click on the navBar button to access his game record. This will make a call to the /getGameRecord endpoint,
which the gateway service will redirect to the history service. This will first check that the user exists and, if so, will return all of the user's 
games saved up to the date of the logged in user.
