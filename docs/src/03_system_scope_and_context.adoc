In WIQ, users can use the WebApp to learn various knowledge through questions created from Wikidata contents. The user interacts directly with the WebApp, 
it extracts information from WikiData to formulate the questions with their answers and stores them in our database. We use various technologies such as JavaScript, 
GitHub and MongoDB in the process of creating and maintaining this project.
