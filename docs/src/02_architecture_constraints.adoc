| Technical Constraint | Reason
| _Web app_ | The application we are developing is a web game called WIQ consisting of automatically generated questions and answers. Users, once logged in, must answer within a certain time to win prizes. 
Additionally, users will also have access to the history of their games. 
| _Documentation_ | Diagrams and ASCIIDoc will be used along with the Arc42 template to keep the documentation updated throughout the development of the web app.
| _Question generator with Wikidata_ | Questions will be automatically generated along with the correct and three incorrect answers. This questions will be generated with Wikidata.
| _Deployment_ | The web app must have a frontend to interact with the game through a web interface, which will be deployed in a virtual machine. To deploy locally 
for testing before releasing, we will use Docker and npm.

| Organizational Constraint | Reason
| _Github_ | Github will be used to keep the web app in a repository with Git version control. Projects will also be used to track who and when someome takes up 
a task and completes it. Issues will be opened for every task involving the web app.
| _Class meetings_ | We will use the time during classes to discuss new tasks that need to be done, as well as to address any common problems we might face in order to solve them as soon as possible.
Other forms of communication, like a Whatsapp group, can be used to communicate between developers.
