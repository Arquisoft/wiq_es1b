=== Decisions

| Decision | Reason
| _React.js_ | We decided to use React.js because it is one of the most popular Javascript libraries used nowadays.
              Although none of us were familiar with it, we thought it would make programming the front-end part of the app better and easier for us.
| _Javascript_ | We chose to stick with Javascript for the development of this web app because we already had knowledge of this language from other subjects. 
                We found it to be an accessible language capable of fulfilling all the app's requirements, including using APIs such as the one from Wikidata.
| _Mongodb_ | For the database aspect of the app, we opted for Mongodb as we believe it is a well-suited option for storing the data necessary for the design and development of the app.

=== Package division

|===
| Package | Description
| _GatewayService_ | This is a crucial part of the project because it connects different services and provides a unified interface to interact with them. 
                    It gives an abstraction layer so that clients can communicate with the underlying services without needing to know the implementation details of each. 
                    It also provides a documentation interface for developers to understand how to interact with services through defined routes.
| _QuestionsGenerator_ | It is responsible for generating questions from Wikidata. It handles loading question templates, generating questions and providing random questions based on selected categories.
| _Record_ | The record package manages and stores game records. It contains the model of each game played, which handles saving and retrieving game-related data. 
            When a user plays the game, their questions are temporarily stored in memory until the game session is completed and saved in the database.
| _Users_ | It is divided into two packages both of them having different functionalities:

- _AuthService_: Handles user authentication and authorization. 

- _UserService_: Manages user-related operations like password hashing, and password and username validation. It also contains the model of the information that the application stores for each user.
| _Webapp_ | It is responsible for creating the web applicationÂ´s user interface and involves various functionalities such as rendering views, handling user interactions and communicating with backend services. 
            It uses React as the base framework, and html and css to manage the visual appearance of the application.
