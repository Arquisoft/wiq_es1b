== Quality Requirements

The main quality objectives of the project will be:

* Usability: The system will be intuitive, through a simple and clear interface.
* Functionality: The system will offer a set of features and tools to fulfill user needs.
* Performance: The system will provide fast and effective responses to the user.
* Maintainability: The system will be easy to maintain, upgrade or extend, without putting the whole project at risk.
* Security: The system will ensure the privacy and integrity of user data.

=== Quality Scenarios

We will categorize the quality scenarios into three main types: usage, change, and failure scenarios.

==== Usage scenarios

|===
| Source | Stimulus | Attribute | Artifact/Environment | Reply | Response measure
| Players | A player wants to start a game | Performance | Game Interface | The system creates the game | Game creation time less than 0.5s
| Players | A player wants to answer a question | Performance | Game Interface | The system updates the question interface | Question update time less than 0.5s
| Players | A player wants to login with username and password | Security | User Interface | The system stores these credentials | These credentials will be encrypted to maintain their security.

|===
| Source | Stimulus | Attribute | Artifact/Environment | Reply | Response measure
| Developers | The game must have more modes to play | Maintainability | Game Interface |A new game mode must be implemented | The implementation of these new mode should be independent of the other game modes
| Developers | We want to migrate the database to another database system | Maintainability | Database | The system do the migration | Encrypted data will be migrated in encrypted form
