=== Quality Scenarios
Dividiremos los escenarios de calidad en escenarios de uso, cambio y fallo.

==== Usage scenarios

|===
| _Source_ | _Stimulus_ | _Attribute_ |_Artifact/Environment_ | _Reply_ | _Response measure_
| Players | A player wants to start a game | Performance | Game Interface | The system creates the game | Game creation time less than 0.5s
| Players | A player wants to answer a question | Performance | Game Interface | The system updates the question interface | Question update time less than 0.5s
| Players | A player wants to login with username and password | Security | User Interface | The system stores these credentials | These credentials will be encrypted to maintain their security.

==== Change scenarios
|===
| _Source_ | _Stimulus_ | _Attribute_| _Artifact/Environment_ | _Reply_ | _Response measure_
| Developers | The game must have more modes to play | Maintainability | Game Interface |A new game mode must be implemented | The implementation of these new mode should be independent of the other game modes
| Developers | We want to migrate the database to another database system | Maintainability | Database | The system do the migration | Encrypted data will be migrated in encrypted form

==== Failure scenarios
|===
| _Source_ | _Stimulus_ | _Attribute_| _Artifact/Environment_ | _Reply_ | _Response measure_
| Game error | An error occurs during the creation of a game | Failure | Game Interface | The system doesn't create the game | The system will alert the user of the error in the creation
