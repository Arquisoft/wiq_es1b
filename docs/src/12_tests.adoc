== Tests

Information about the different tests we have done.

=== Unit tests

We have done unit testing in all the different components of the webapp and services, all of these trying to test
every aspect of the component by mocking database accesses to be able to get the most coverage percentage possible.
All the tests pass successfully and give us a really good test coverage on the lines of the component they test.
Here are the overall results of the components of the webapp:

There is a test suite for each service or app has. Here are the results of those tests:

=== E2E tests

In addition to the unit tests we have done some E2E tests too. These tests are able to make sure 
all our components work well while used together. We have done this tests in the cases of a user
creating an account, loging in, playing the game and whatching the record. Here are the results of those tests, all 
of them pass successfully.

=== Load tests

Gatling was used to make load tests to test our gateway and see how it performed with a lot of requests.
We made load tests to the login and to the game. All the information about these tests are in the folder loadtests of the project.
Here are some important data of the tests to give an overall view of how they went.

These tests consist of two users starting to do the test each second for 60 seconds, in total 120 users.
