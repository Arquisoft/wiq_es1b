== Introduction and Goals

HappySw, a software development company, has been hired by RTVE in order to develop an experimental online version of the famous spanish program “Saber y Ganar”, a well-known question and answer contest.

Our main objective is to create a web application in which users have to sign up and answer a series of questions generated automatically from the data stored in Wikidata. 
After that, users will be awarded according to the number of correct answers.

We also expect to provide a practical software that fulfills customer expectations.
