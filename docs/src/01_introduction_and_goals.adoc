== Introduction and Goals
HappySw, a software development company, has been hired by RTVE in order to develop an experimental online version of the famous spanish program “Saber y Ganar”, a well-known question and answer contest.

Our main objective is to create a web application in which users have to sign up and answer a series of questions generated automatically from the data stored in Wikidata. After that, users will be awarded according to the number of correct answers.

We also expect to provide a practical software that fulfills customer expectations.

=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
